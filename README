stormforhpc
--------

stormforhpc enables the use of Apache Storm in a non-dedicated cluster environment,
being administered by typical batch scheduler. We are currently supporting
the PBS (Moab) scheduler, although a port to a scheduler such as Condor would be very trivial.

The pbs-example.sh provide an example of how to use stormforhpc with PBS.

Pre-requisites
--------------
stormforhpc needs Apache Storm 0.9.2, Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.6 and a batch scheduler such as PBS.
